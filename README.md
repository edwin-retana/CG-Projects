# CG-Projects

These projects were assigned for CS 300 – Computer Graphics during the Spring 2021 semester at Whitman College.

Here are very brief descriptions of the programs:

Program 1 – A simple 2D drawing using basic Javascript and graphics context functions.

Program 2 – A simple paint program that allows the user to paint a shape, with a specified shape, to draw to either the foreground or background via chroma keying.  Additionally, an introduction to basic CSS.

Program 3 – A very simple kernel filter application.

Program 4 – Simple data plotting using the lineTo() function, an introduction to data import in Javascript.

Program 5 – A simple interactive poseable 2D figure.

Program 6 – A script that takes in an image input and generates a 3D terrain map of it with two viewports (one rotating 360degrees around the map, the other a static top-down perspective).
