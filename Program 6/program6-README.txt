This program uses modified code from Professor William Bares.

To get it running, I had to run (in my Terminal on Mac):
Python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

And then type into my web browser (Firefox):
http://127.0.0.1:8000/program6.html

The images included were all successfully loaded in, and one of the images chosen is one of a rapper just to see how a different image file would be handled (code unchanged) and what a person would look like mapped with terrain.  Also, because it's kinda got a funny output.

The one included is larger as it is regular terrain.

The program runs slowly when the renderer's width and height is too large,
hence why it is not too big.
